      rules:
        - allow: [ Group, User, Component, API ] # <--- Ensure all Kinds are listed here

      # If this processor is also scanning the repo, ensure its settings 
      # allow all the required entity kinds. 
      # Check your full processor configuration if the error persists.
      # For example:
